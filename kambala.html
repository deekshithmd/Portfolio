                   In earlier days these races were happening in rural villeges. In those days in rural areas of this coastal area like Kundapura, Udupi, Moodabidri, Mangalore after all process of paddy crop that field will be free for few months, So in that time these rural area people started this race to get some entertainment for relaxation. So in that time there was no dedicated tracks like today what we see so they organized these events in the field only.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   As the time passed this traditional way of race got modern touch. So eventually some dedicated tracks were built for this race. For this race initially the race track should be filled with water. There are few important parts in Kambala. <br>
