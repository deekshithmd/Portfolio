                   Git is one of the open source distributed version control system which is used to track changes done on the code in repository. Using this we can track each and every small changes done on any file in the repository. This tool can be used in 2 ways either by using command line or by using GUI applications like Github Desktop. 
                
                    Github is one of the Internet hosting for software development and version control, It uses git for the version control system. This software/website offers both distributed version control and source code management.

                    Terminologies/functionalities of Github
                    <ol>
                        <li>Commit</li> 
                        <li>Push</li> 
                        <li>Pull</li> 
                        <li>Fork</li>
                        <li>Pull Request</li>
                        <li>Branching</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>Commit:</h4>
                    This is simple message required to update the file in github. This can be done by using few keywords like refactor, feat, docs etc. This message shows in github so that other user can understand what changes done in the code/file.
                    <h4>Push:</h4>
                    This is the functionality which is used to apply the changes done in local repository to the online repository.At first code changes done in local repository using any code editor then it will be uploaded to the central repository which is online repository.
                    <h4>Pull:</h4>
                    This is the functionality used to get the code repository in local computer. This is used in the scenarios like when some person is on leave for some day, then after few days he can look at all the changes done in code repository can be checked by using this functionality.
                    <h4>Fork:</h4>
                    This functionality is used to get the copy of the code in local repository, Then you can make changes to the project without affecting original repository. Then to merge that changes Pull Request functionality is used. So any person who want to contribute to the project can fork the repository and do chnages then can request to merge that change.
                    <h4>Pull Request:</h4>
                    This is the functionality which shows the requests done by the contributers. Any person who wishes to contribute to the project he forks and does the changes then submits and requests for pulling that into the project. Then owner of the repository checks the requests and if there is no any problem then continues to merge that into the main, So that contributer's feature available in the project.
                    <h4>Branching:</h4>
                    This functionality is used to create parallel working directory, This will be contained within the repository only but does not affect the main repository. Then after making all changes if that looks good feature for the project then he can merge that into the main so that now it will be part of your projects.

                    Git plays major role in the software development field. This helps to develop projects by collaborating with multiple developers. Git made developers work easy by providing feature of getting piece of code from multiple developers and add that into project and make the project good.
